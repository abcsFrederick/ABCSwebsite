![Transcript coverage of ADRM1]("{{ "/" | absolute_url }}"/assets/ADRM1-coverage.png)
The top four tracks show expression of ADRM1 in KO, trunc and their respective WT cell lines. The y-axes represent CPM (counts per million reads) normalized counts.  Reads spanning junctions are displayed as arcs annotated with their CPM normalized counts. The bottom track shows the primary transcript for ADRM1 in the Gencode v19 database, with genomic coordinates along Chromosome 1 displayed on the bottom.
