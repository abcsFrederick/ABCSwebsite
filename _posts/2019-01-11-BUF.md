Come join us for our next Bioinformatics User Forum meeting on Jan 11 in the ATRF Auditorium in Frederick. Our main speaker, Vishal Koparde, will be presenting a *use-case on developing an NGS analysis pipeline in the cloud*, and then we will break into small groups for roundtable discussions (see details in the agenda below).
 
We will also have an informal lunch-time gathering in the ATRF Atrium prior to the meeting.
